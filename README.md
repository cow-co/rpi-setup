# Raspberry Pi Setup Script

A simple script for setting up my raspberry pi in the way that I want (mostly).

Some things cannot be done particularly nicely from a script (eg. generating Mullvad config files) so those will still need to be done manually. But otherwise, it takes care of a lot of stuff.
